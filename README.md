# SimpleUI for KOReader

A clean, distraction-free UI plugin for KOReader that transforms your reading experience. SimpleUI adds a **dedicated Desktop home screen**, a customisable bottom navigation bar, and a top status bar, giving you instant access to your library, history, collections, and reading stats without navigating through nested menus.

## Features

### Desktop
The centrepiece of SimpleUI. A home screen that gives you everything at a glance:

- **Clock & Date** — a large, readable clock with full date display, always visible on your home screen
- **Currently Reading** — shows your active book with cover art, title, author, reading progress bar, percentage read, and estimated time left
- **Recent Books** — a row of up to 5 recent books with cover thumbnails and progress indicators; tap any to resume reading
- **Collections** — your KOReader collections displayed as tappable cards, right on the home screen
- **Reading Goals** — visual progress tracker for your daily, weekly or monthly reading goals
- **Reading Stats** — compact stat cards showing your reading activity at a glance
- **Quick Actions** — up to 3 customisable rows of shortcut buttons (Library, History, Wi-Fi toggle, Brightness, Stats, and more)
- **Quote of the Day** — optional literary quote header, randomly picked from a curated list of 100+ quotes
- **Custom Header** — choose between clock, clock + date, a custom text label, or the Quote of the Day as your Desktop header
- **Module ordering** — rearrange Desktop modules in any order to match your workflow
- **Start with Desktop** — set the Desktop as the first screen KOReader opens, so your home screen greets you every time you pick up your device

### Bottom Navigation Bar
A persistent tab bar at the bottom of the screen for one-tap navigation:

- Up to **5 fully customisable tabs**: Library, History, Collections, Favorites, Continue Reading, Desktop, Wi-Fi Toggle, Brightness, Stats, and custom folder/collection shortcuts
- **3 display modes**: icons only, text only, or icons + text
- **Hold anywhere on the bar** to instantly open the navigation settings

### Top Status Bar
A slim status bar always visible at the top of the screen:

- Displays **clock, battery level, Wi-Fi status, frontlight brightness, disk usage, and RAM** — all configurable
- Each item can be placed on the **left or right** side independently

### Quick Actions
Shortcut buttons configurable both in the Desktop and in the bottom bar:

- Assign any tab to a **custom folder**, **collection**, or **KOReader plugin action**
- Quick **Wi-Fi toggle** and **frontlight control** directly from the bar
- **Power menu** (Sleep, Restart, Shutdown) accessible as a tab

### Settings
All features are accessible via **Menu → Tools → SimpleUI**

## 🔧 Customising Quotes

To add, remove or edit the Quote of the Day pool, open `quotes.lua` inside the plugin folder. Each entry follows this format:

```lua
{ q = "Quote text.", a = "Author Name", b = "Book Title (optional)" }
```

Changes take effect the next time the Desktop is opened.
